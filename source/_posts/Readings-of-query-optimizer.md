>  Query Optimizer is one of the hard part of  Relational Database Implimentation. A good reading of the related paper will help you understand why the code is implimented as such. Here I choose some of the basic papers of query optimizer.

[Query optimization Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_optimization) : Fundamentals about query optimization, that's a good palace to start.
[An Overview of Query Optimization in Relational Systems
](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=D6EAC438BC476CE50F9D7399D1B01E07?doi=10.1.1.137.3356&rep=rep1&type=pdf) : a good review of considerations of query optimizer.
[Access Path Selection in a Relational Database Management System](https://wenku.baidu.com/view/b1889fd9d15abe23482f4d0c.html) : Classic System R database optimizer implimentation.
