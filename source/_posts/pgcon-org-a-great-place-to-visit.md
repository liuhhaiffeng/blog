I found a great sit [pgcon.org](http://www.pgcon.org) which holds all conference slides dating back to year 2007. Where you can really
learn some stuff.

This slide [Hack into the query optimizer](https://www.pgcon.org/2011/schedule/attachments/188_Planner%20talk.pdf) by Tome Lane is really useful for all who want to grasp the basic ideas
behind the query optimizer.
