        to produce a final sorted output.  This may allow sort

       </p><p>        The default is 150,000 tuples.  Note that higher values are typically
        not much more effective, and may be counter-productive, since the
        priority queue is sensitive to the size of available CPU cache, whereas
        the default strategy sorts runs using a <em class="firstterm">cache
        oblivious</em> algorithm.  This property allows the default sort
        strategy to automatically and transparently make effective use
        of available CPU cache.

      is to issue writes of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">dirty</span>”</span> (new or modified) shared
      buffers.  It writes shared buffers so server processes handling
      user queries seldom or never need to wait for a write to occur.
      However, the background writer does cause a net overall
      increase in I/O load, because while a repeatedly-dirtied page might
      otherwise be written only once per checkpoint interval, the
      background writer might write it several times as it is dirtied
      in the same interval.  The parameters discussed in this subsection
      can be used to tune the behavior for local needs.

         However, if the database is often busy with multiple queries issued in
         concurrent sessions, lower values may be sufficient to keep the disk
         array busy.  A value higher than needed to keep the disks busy will
         only result in extra CPU overhead.
         SSDs and other memory-based storage can often process many

        </p><p>         Note that parallel queries may consume very substantially more
         resources than non-parallel queries, because each worker process is
         a completely separate process which has roughly the same impact on the
         system as an additional user session.  This should be taken into
         account when choosing a value for this setting, as well as when
         configuring other settings that control resource utilization, such

         <code class="varname">work_mem</code> are applied individually to each worker,
         which means the total utilization may be much higher across all
         processes than it would normally be for any single process.

         as much CPU time, memory, I/O bandwidth, and so forth as a query which
